# Crud Application

## Summary
This project contains the principle of a technical test for the development of a web service rest for an IUD application (AKA CRUD).

## Description
I have started to create a CRUD with API Rest in React JS. I used Material UI to implement Material Design, Axios for HTTP requests and React Hooks. 
This application will make it possible to consult a list of users with the details of each one of them where it will be possible to consult, edit or delete, in turn, the data individually.
